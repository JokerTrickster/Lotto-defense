## Execution Strategy
Sequential foundation tasks must complete first:
1. ✅ #17 → State Machine (foundation)
2. ✅ #19 → Grid System (foundation)
3. ✅ #13 → Monster Spawning (ready after #19)
4. ✅ #14 → Combat System (created minimal unit infrastructure)
5. ✅ #16 → Unit Synthesis (code complete, needs Unity Editor setup)
6. ✅ #18 → Unit Upgrade (code complete, needs Unity Editor UI setup)
7. Next: #12 → Unit Placement (basic placement UI)
8. Next: #15 → Round Management (ready after #14)
9. Final: #20 → Polish & Balance (ready after #15, #16, #18)

## Notes
- Issue #21 (Unit Data & Gacha) was listed as complete but not implemented
- Issue #14 created minimal unit infrastructure to unblock combat
- Full gacha system will be implemented with #12 (Unit Placement)
- Issue #16 complete at code level, requires Unity Editor for asset creation
  - Need to create 12 UnitData assets first
  - Then create 10 SynthesisRecipe assets using provided templates
  - UI prefabs and scene setup also required
